> {%= description %}

This module contains an extract of the [language-database of `groc`](http://nevir.github.io/groc/languages.html)
with information about how single- and multi-line comments are written in different languages.

## Basic usage

```js
var commentPattern = require('{%= name %}');
var p = commentPattern('filename.js');
```
This will lead to `p` being: 

{%= commentPatterns('filename.js') %}

* **name** is the name of the language
* **nameMatchers** is an array of file extensions of filenames that 
  files in this language usually have.
* **multiLineComment** is an array of patterns for comments that may span multiple lines
  * **start** is the beginning of a comment
  * **middle** is a character of a regex that occurs in front of each comment line
  * **end** marks the end of the comment
* **singleLineComment** is the prefix of comments that go until the end of the line

## Variation (regex)

It is also possible to retrieve a regular expression that matches comments
(up to the next line of code):

```js
var re = commentPattern.regex('filename.js');
```
The result `re` will be:

{%= commentPatterns_regex('filename.js') %}

* **regex** is the actual regular expression. It matches the comments in a string,
  including any empty lines after the comment.
* **cg** are constant values refering to capturing groups of the regex.
  * `match[cg.indent]` contains the spaces that indent comment-start-delimiter.
  * `match[cg.wholeComment]` matches the comment including delimiters.
  * `match[cg.contentStart]` is the first group that captures the contents of the comment
    In this case, there are multiple possible delimiters, so dependending on which 
    delimiter is used, `match[cg.contentStart]` or `match[cg.contentStart + 1]` is
    filled. the others are undefined.
* **middle** contains one pattern for each group after `cg.contentStart` that matches
  the prefix used before comment lines. It can be used to remove this prefix.
  If the middle-prefix for this capturing group is empty (`''`), the pattern is `null`.
* **name** is the language name for debugging purposes.  

## Variation (codeContext)

Some languages have functions that can categorize a single line of code (mostly the one 
directly after the comment), in order to determine the context of a apidoc comment.

```js
var codeContext = 
```

## The database

The language-specification can be found in the 
`languages`-directory. There is one file
for each language. The actual databases will be
created from these files on `prepublish`.
